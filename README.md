# Tyrion
Tyrion buffs Lothern Seaguards since he leads "Eatain" Faction. Ellyrion Reavers are added in to give this army some mobility support, but they are extreme glass cannons and needs to be microed heavily (Which is something I can't manage)
## Stage 1
  * Lothern Seaguard (Shield):
    * +10 Armour
    * +4% Physical Resistance
  * Ellyrion Reaver (Melee):
    * +75% AP-Weapon Strength
    * +3 Anti-Large Bonus
    * +10 Charge Bonus
## Stage 2
  * Lothern Seaguard (Shield):
    * +20 Armour
    * +8% Physical Resistance
  * Ellyrion Reaver (Melee):
    * +150% AP-Weapon Strength
    * +6 Anti-Large Bonus
    * +20 Charge Bonus
## Stage 3
  * Lothern Seaguard (Shield):
    * +30 Armour
    * +15% Physical Resistance
    * Enable "Bracing Stance"
      - Toggleable Ability
      - Upon activation, enter the preparation phase, reduce range by 100%, reduce speed by 35%, increase melee defence by 5
      - After 10s, enter the bracing stance, reduce range by 100%, reduce speed by 50%, increase melee defence by 10, increase charge resistance by 200%, increase ward save by 10%, gain "Expert Charge Defence"
      - Comment: You can activate this ability 10s before contact to have "Expert Charge Defence", but lose out on their missile damage. You can also just activate it upon contact to have them perform better in melee, but the charge defence is not utilized.
  * Lothern Seaguard (Without Shield):
    * Improved Missile Weapon
      - Missile Weapon now has high AP-ratio
      - Missile Weapon has longer range
    * Enable "Exposing Volley" 
      - Active Ability, 2 charges per battle
      - Fire a volley that does about half the damage, but enemies hit will have less shield parry and missile resistance for 60s
      - Comment: This ability can be fired while your normal missile attack is in cooldown, granting you some extra dps. But this is mostly used to focus fire down high value enemy units.
  * Ellyrion Reaver (Melee):
    * +300% AP-Weapon Strength
    * +12 Anti-Large Bonus
    * +40 Charge Bonus
    * +6 Melee Attack/ Defence
    * Enable "Strider"
  * Ellyrion Reaver Archer:
    * +6 Melee Attack/ Defence
    * Improved Missile Weapon
      - Missile Weapon now has high AP-ratio
    * Enable "Strider"
# Teclis
Teclis buffs phoenix units, mainly because he has a phoenix mount in game, I have no idea if it is lore accurate. Since Arcane phoenix is the best variant and is doomstack material, other phoenixes are given buffs to match up to it. He also buffs Swordmaster of Hoeth as leader of "Order of Loremasters", though they are one of the best damage-dealing infantry, none of the units in this category does well in VH battle difficulty.
## Stage 1
  * Flamespyre Phoenix
    * +5 Charge Bonus
    * +7% Weapon Strength
## Stage 2
  * Flamespyre Phoenix
    * +10 Charge Bonus
    * +15% Weapon Strength
    * +3 Melee Attack
## Stage 3
  * Flamespyre Phoenix
    * +10 Charge Bonus
    * +15% Weapon Strength
    * +3 Melee Attack
    * Enable upgraded version of "Wake of Fire"
      - Active Ability, 5 charges per battle
      - Comparing to the vanilla ability, it has higher damage and high AP-ratio. It also has a slightly higher AoE.
      - You still keep the vanilla version of "Wake of Fire"
      - Comment: The reason why you get to keep the vanilla version is.... I don't know how to disable it. Some how the disable option does not work for the scope "character_to_force_own". But the upgraded version does pack a punch when it lands in a blob of enemy infantry.
  * Frostheart Phoenix
    * Enable "Rebirth"
  * Swordmasters of Hoeth
    * Enable "Master of Swords"
      - Toggleable Ability
      - While activated, reduce Anti-Infantry Bonus by 14, increase Anti-Large Bonus by 20, gain "Charge Defence vs Large"
      - Comment: Use them as either a anti-large or anti-infantry unit.
    * Enable "Unparalleled Finesse"
      - Active Ability, 60s CD (+90s duration)
      - Upon activation, gain 20% ward save, 10 Melee Attack/ Defence, lasts 60s
      - After 60s, your soldiers are exhausted and suffer -10% ward save, -5 Melee Attack/ Defence, lasts 30s

# Eltharion
Buffs Mistwalker units. Upon unlocking stage 1, 5 units of Athel Tamarha Faithbearers, Sentinels of Astaril and Spire Guard of Tor Yvresse plus 2 units of Skyhawks will be available from any region with tier 3 barracks. 2 units of Knights of Tor Gaval will be available from Dragon's Lair. Note: If you are playing as Yvress, all capacity upgrades will be doubled, since these are copies of the original units and enjoy the same buffs. This will make the game easier, buff I believe this is necessary for all other high elf factions to enjoy Mistwalkers.
## Stage 1
  * Sentinels of Astaril
    * +3% Missile Damage
  * Spire Guard of Tor Yvresse
    * +2 Melee Defence
    * +5% Missile Resistance

      - Comment: The Skyhawks are normally away from your main force and are very vulnerable against enemy cavalry. This will hopefully help them reposition and survive.
# Imrik
Buffs Dragons and Dragon Princes. Since Star Dragons are doomstack material, they do not get anything. Other dragons are given new abilities to make you mix them. As for dragon princes.... Cavalry will never be on the same level as a single entity flying beast (the best flying beast in the game for that matter), at least they are now equivalent to Grail Knight.
## Stage 1
  * Sun Dragon
    * +6% Weapon Strength
    * +5 Anti-Large Bonus
  * Moon Dragon
    * +3 Anti-Infantry Bonus
## Stage 2

    * +12% Weapon Strength
    * +10 Anti-Large Bonus
  * Moon Dragon
    * +7 Anti-Infantry Bonus
  * Dragon Prince
    * Enable "Perfect Vigour"
## Stage 3
  * Sun Dragon
    * +25% Weapon Strength
    * +20 Anti-Large Bonus
    * Enable "Incinerate"
      - Active Ability, 1 Charge per battle
      - Direct damage, very effective against single entity units, not effective against multiple entities
      - Comment: "Balanced" for Ultra unit scale, probably totally broke if you play in smaller unit scales. (Would be nice if direct damage spells scale with unit scale......) I intend it to be used against single entity monsters with > 6000 Health, but lords normally have less health. You can easily general snipe with this ability, but I really don't want to nerf it since it would do very little to mosters.
  * Moon Dragon
    * +15 Anti-Infantry Bonus
    * Enable "Serenity"
      - Active Ability, 2 Charges per battle
      - When activated, all friendly units nearby recovers health
      - Basically 2 bound uses of "Earth Blood", but can only cast around the unit itself and DOES NOT cap at 4 units
      - Comment: Spare yourself the life Mage, they will do the healing. Now you can bring a fire Mage for destruction and theme.
  * Dragon Prince
    * +150% AP Weapon Strength
    * -60% Non-AP Weapon Strength
    * Enable "Perfect Vigour"
